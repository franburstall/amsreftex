;;; Commentary:

;; Usage:
;; Download `amsreftex.el`, put it somewhere in your load-path
;; and then do
;; 
;; (require 'amsreftex)
;; (turn-on-amsreftex)
;; 
;; After this, `reftex` should detect if you are using `amsrefs`
;; databases and Just Work.
;; 
;; This works by checking for the existence of `\bibselect` or
;; `\bib` macros.  You may need to re-parse your document with
;; `M-x reftex-parse-all` after inserting these macros for the
;; first time.
;; 
;; If, for any reason, you want to revert to vanilla `reftex`,
;; just do `M-x turn-off-amsreftex`.
;;
;; Configuration:
;; There is almost nothing to configure.  The one exception: by
;; default, `amsreftex` inspects $TEXINPUTS to find the
;; search-path for `amsrefs` databases (.ltb files).
;; Customize `reftex-ltbpath-environment-variables' to change this.

;; Implementation:
;; Vanilla reftex is mostly agnostic about the format of the
;; bibliography databases it uses.  It parses them into an internal
;; format with which it works from then on.  To adapt reftex to work
;; with amsrefs databases, we need only adjust the workings of 10
;; functions which make bibtex-specific assumptions (often in the shape
;; of regexps) to accomplish their ends.  These are:
;; `reftex-locate-bibliography-files'
;; `reftex-parse-bibtex-entry'
;; `reftex-get-crossref-alist'
;; `reftex-extract-bib-entries'
;; `reftex-extract-bib-entries-from-thebibliography'
;; `reftex-pop-to-bibtex-entry'
;; `reftex-echo-cite'
;; `reftex-end-of-bibentry'
;; `reftex-parse-from-file'
;; `reftex-bibtex-selection-callback'
;; We adjust these functions by advising them to call alternatives if
;; we are in an document using amsrefs.
;; 
;; We notify the presence of amsrefs databases by adding a cell to the
;; document's `reftex-docstruct-symbol' alist (with car 'database and
;; currently ignored cdr).  This is done by unconditionally replacing
;; `reftex-parse-from-file' by `amsreftex-parse-from-file' when
;; amsreftex is turned on.  Thereafter, most of the functions above
;; are advised to check for this cell and call an amsrefs-friendly
;; replacement if it is present.
;;
;; The only exceptions to this rule are `reftex-parse-from-file',
;; discussed above, `reftex-bibtex-selection-callback' and
;; `reftex-end-of-bib-entry'.  The latter are called from a selection
;; buffer where the docstruct alist is not available and so we
;; unconditionally replace them with versions that make its own test
;; for amsrefs.

;; Searching for files: we setup the ltb file type for
;; reftex-locate-file.  For this, it suffices to setup the following
;; variables:
(defcustom reftex-ltbpath-environment-variables '("TEXINPUTS")
  "List of specifications how to retrieve search path for .ltb database files.
Several entries are possible.
- If an element is the name of an environment variable, its content is used.
- If an element starts with an exclamation mark, it is used as a command
  to retrieve the path.  A typical command with the kpathsearch library would
  be `!kpsewhich -show-path=.tex'.
- Otherwise the element itself is interpreted as a path.
Multiple directories can be separated by the system dependent `path-separator'.
Directories ending in `//' or `!!' will be expanded recursively.

;; by locale collate order?  To do so, we must go down the rabbit hole
;; of converting TeX accents and special characters to utf-8.  On the
;; other hand, what do journals do?  A small sampling from MathSciNet
;; suggests that, for example, Ørsted gets sorted as if Orsted by
;; Trans. AMS and so we will do similarly.  We brutally strip out
;; accents and special characters as though it is still the 1970's and
;; ASCII is king.  We may return to this later and try to do better.

;;* TO DO:

;;**  Package for MELPA
;;     - Package-Requires
;;     - URL
;;     - lots of linting


;;* NEXT:
;; (a) Look into better formatting of \bib by auctex.  Best option is
;; no formatting.  Should add an entry to
;; LaTeX-indent-environment-list.  Learn about how filling works...
